# What is it?

Developed previously for my old Full-Moon Networks DoctorWhoRP server, this SWEP fixes a common problem present in doctor who roleplay servers. That problem being the abuse of the TARDIS, particularly the spawning/despawning. For example, let's say the TARDIS is really low on health and the player has to repair, previously most players would simply respawn the TARDIS via spawnmenu, which is exploitative and doesn't belong in a roleplay scenario.

# The solution

With this addon that mentioned problem is no more, now the TARDIS is like a secondary character within a player's roleplay. Requiring it to be taken care of and not get too damaged, otherwise they will lose access to their TARDIS - and this time there is no spawnmenu functionality there to save the player this time!

# Open Source

This addon is open source, and you are very welcome to make changes to the addon yourself! All I ask is that if you want your updated version of the addon released onto the workshop, request for it to be updated here and I will add you as a collaborator. There is some leftover code that is commented out from my server that made it so certain TARDIS interiors were restricted based on the player's job, such as rani. I'm sure if any dev wants to reimplement that functionality and expand upon it, they can :)
